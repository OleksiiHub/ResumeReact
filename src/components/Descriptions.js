                I'm a Software Engineer with 10 years of experience and all this time
                I've been helping businesses to reach their goals by using modern (and
                sometimes outdated) technologies. For this time I've been working in
                different technical sides of products and have experience with
                front-end (JS, TypeScript, React, Angular), and mobile
                (React Native).
